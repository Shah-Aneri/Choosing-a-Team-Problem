# Choosing-a-Team-Problem


➔ This problem has been solved using the idea of storing the previous skills as the loop traverses. This is not a greedy 
approach since it stores all the skills obtained for a given object and then returns the maximum skill obtained.

➔ The search abstractions for this problem are as stated below:

◆ State Space: All possible subjects with their skill and cost.

◆ Successor Function: All possible subject with maximum skill within the given budget.

◆ Cost: No cost.

◆ Goal State: Maximum skill with the budget constraint.
